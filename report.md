Citi bike report

1. Citi bike needs to add some sort of validation to the birth field so that people donâ€™t leave it on 1969 as a default.
2. Non-binary gender is more popular than before, this should be something to consider in marketing.
3.  The most popular stations to end a trip are around the most popular public transit stations such as Grand Central.
4. The Average age of ridership did not decrease even though Covid-19 affects the older population more than the younger
5. The most popular time to start a trip is between 5-6pm and 8-9am in the wintertime. In the summer, this changes. 8-9am are not as popular, probably because riders do not want to show up for work sweaty.
